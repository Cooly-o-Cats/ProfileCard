## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learned quite a few things throughout this project, but #1 was differently to be cautious and check for margin and padding. Many times I would add an element, such as an **h2** and it would mess up my "design". I simply just had to remove the margin using:
```css
h2{
margin: 0;
}
```
So I just need to be more careful in the future with this!
